only for fun and naively playing

I won't say it is done very well, 
since I'm very occupied by my own research, and all my teammates seem also really busy.

My contributions for the project:
Team management,
Writing Intro, help a teammate with the data processing code,
benchmarks (all classical models), and LSTM.

If you happen to see this repo, and you feel the quality is too terrible,
I'm so sorry and please ignore it.

I can't control the qualities for th works due to my own time limits.


I'm putting here only to keep a record, and when my new computer comes, 
I'll pull it down.

Honestly, I'm so embrassed the project.
